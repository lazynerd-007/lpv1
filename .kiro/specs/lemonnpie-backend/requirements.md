# LemonNPie Backend API Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a comprehensive Python FastAPI backend to support the LemonNPie Nollywood movie review platform. The backend will replace the current mock data implementation and provide a robust, scalable API that serves the existing Vue.js frontend while supporting future mobile applications and third-party integrations.

## Glossary

- **LemonNPie_API**: The FastAPI backend system that provides RESTful endpoints for the movie review platform
- **Authentication_Service**: JWT-based authentication and authorization system
- **Movie_Database**: PostgreSQL database storing movie, series, and related metadata
- **Review_System**: Component handling user reviews, ratings, and moderation
- **User_Management**: System managing user accounts, profiles, and role-based access
- **Admin_Panel**: Administrative interface for content and user management
- **Content_Moderation**: Automated and manual content review system
- **Analytics_Engine**: System for tracking user behavior and generating insights
- **File_Storage**: Cloud-based storage for images, videos, and other media assets
- **Cache_Layer**: Redis-based caching system for improved performance
- **Search_Engine**: Full-text search functionality for movies, reviews, and users
- **Notification_System**: Real-time notification delivery system
- **Rate_Limiter**: API request throttling and abuse prevention system
