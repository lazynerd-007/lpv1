## 3. Technical Deep Dive

### 3.1. Architecture Patterns

**State Management Pattern:**
```typescript
// Pinia stores follow consistent patterns
export const useMovieStore = defineStore('movie', () => {
  // State (reactive refs)
  const movies = ref<Movie[]>([])
  const isLoading = ref(false)
  
  // Getters (computed)
  const featuredMovies = computed(() => 
    movies.value.filter(m => m.featured)
  )
  
  // Actions (functions)
  const fetchMovies = async () => {
    // Async operations with proper error handling
  }
  
  return { movies, isLoading, featuredMovies, fetchMovies }
})
```

**Component Composition Pattern:**
```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
// Composables for reusable logic
const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme()
const { announceToScreenReader } = useAccessibility()

// Props with TypeScript
interface Props {
  movie: Movie
  variant?: 'default' | 'featured' | 'compact'
}
const props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), {
  variant: 'default'
})
</script>
```

### 3.2. Performance Optimizations

**Current Implementations:**
1. **Lazy Loading**: All routes are lazy-loaded with dynamic imports
2. **Code Splitting**: Vendor chunks separated (Vue, Pinia, UI libraries)
3. **Image Optimization**: Critical images preloaded, lazy loading implemented
4. **Bundle Analysis**: Manual chunking configured in Vite

**Performance Metrics Tracking:**
```typescript
// Implemented in utils/performance.ts
export function measurePerformance() {
  // FCP, LCP, FID, CLS, TTFB tracking
  // Performance observer for real-time metrics
}
```

### 3.3. Accessibility Implementation

**Current Features:**
- Screen reader announcements
- Focus management and trapping
- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA attributes and roles
- Color contrast compliance
- Semantic HTML structure

**Accessibility Composable:**
```typescript
export function useAccessibility() {
  const announceToScreenReader = (message: string) => {
    // Live region announcements
  }
  
  const setupFocusTrap = (container: HTMLElement) => {
    // Modal and dropdown focus management
  }
  
  return { announceToScreenReader, setupFocusTrap }
}
```

### 3.4. Testing Strategy

**Current Coverage:**
- Unit tests for stores (userStore, movieStore)
- Component tests for UI components (LemonPieRating)
- Integration test setup with Happy DOM
- Mock implementations for browser APIs

**Test Structure:**
```typescript
describe('LemonPieRating', () => {
  it('displays correct emoji for rating ranges', () => {
    // Lemon (1-4), Neutral (5-6), Pie (7-10)
  })
  
  it('handles interactive mode correctly', () => {
    // Click events and rating changes
  })
})
```
